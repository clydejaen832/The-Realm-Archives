        "origins remastered": `Origins Remastered: the classic world you loved, now bigger, 
better, and bolder. Team up with friends, tackle new challenges, and explore upgraded lands 
full of secrets and surprises.`,

        "sariel": `Sariel — Progeny

Domain: Creation, interaction, guidance of mortals
Description: Sariel is the Archangel of Progeny, tasked with guiding and nurturing life across
the server. Once, he often wandered among mortals, interacting freely with players, observing
their growth, and subtly shaping events. When he sensed a player’s potential, he might spawn 
challenges, mobs, or opportunities that allowed them to grow stronger, fostering both courage 
and ingenuity. However, as the server’s world expanded, Sariel’s duties became stricter and 
more demanding, forcing him to limit his interactions. Now, he remains a silent guardian in 
most cases, only stepping into the player’s world in carefully measured ways, balancing guidance 
with responsibility. His presence is felt more in subtle influences than in direct conversation, 
a bittersweet restraint for one who once walked freely among the living.`,

        "seraphiel": `Seraphiel — Radiance

Domain: Light, purity, illumination of truth
Description: Seraphiel governs the essence of radiance and truth, ensuring light penetrates the 
darkest corners of the world. Ever vigilant, Seraphiel spreads enlightenment and clarity, guiding 
mortals toward understanding and wisdom. Her domain is unwavering, and her interventions are 
precise—manifested in moments of revelation, sudden clarity, or the illumination of hidden paths. 
Seraphiel does not falter, dutifully maintaining balance between light and shadow, favoring those 
who act with honesty and integrity.`,

        "chamuel": `Chamuel — Affection

Domain: Love, compassion, connection
Description: Chamuel is the Archangel of Affection, a being of gentle warmth who nurtures bonds 
between mortals. He ensures that love, empathy, and mutual respect flourish across the realms. 
Mortals touched by Chamuel’s influence often feel unexpected acts of kindness or find guidance 
in forming meaningful connections. Chamuel exercises his duties with tender precision, guarding 
hearts and fostering trust. Though he rarely intervenes in conflicts directly, his presence 
subtly shapes harmony wherever it is most needed.`,

        "raphael": `Raphael — Wisdom

Domain: Knowledge, insight, guidance
Description: Raphael embodies wisdom, foresight, and understanding. He watches over mortals who 
seek knowledge, subtly guiding decisions and shaping the outcomes of their quests. His interventions 
are rarely overt, instead inspiring insight and strategy through subtle signs or whispered truths. 
Raphael governs his domain with measured attention, ensuring that learning, discernment, and prudence 
flourish throughout the server. Those who follow his guidance often find solutions where none seemed 
possible.`,

        "jophiel": `Jophiel — Shadows

Domain: Secrets, subtlety, protection in darkness
Description: Jophiel presides over shadows, guarding the unseen and protecting what mortals cannot 
perceive. He monitors hidden forces, secrets, and the quiet moments where balance must be maintained. 
Mortals under his subtle influence often notice protection in the unseen, guidance through intuition, 
or revelations hidden in darkness. Jophiel fulfills his duties without fanfare, ensuring that shadows 
serve as a tool for wisdom and safety rather than fear or chaos.`,

        "uriel": `Uriel — Life

Domain: Vitality, growth, preservation
Description: Uriel is the Archangel of Life, responsible for sustaining vitality and nurturing growth. 
He watches over mortals and creatures alike, maintaining the delicate balance between life and decay. 
His presence brings renewal, recovery, and the quiet assurance that life continues even in adversity. 
Uriel’s interventions are subtle but crucial, ensuring that life thrives and that mortals understand 
the value of preservation, resilience, and harmony.`,

        "michael": `Michael — Judgement

Domain: Justice, order, accountability
Description: Michael is the Archangel of Judgement, tasked with upholding order and ensuring that 
actions bear consequences. He governs impartially, rewarding virtue and punishing transgression with 
unwavering diligence. Mortals influenced by Michael may find that justice prevails in their endeavors, 
sometimes in ways that seem sudden or unexpected. His authority is absolute, yet tempered with fairness, 
embodying the principle that all deeds—great or small—will eventually face judgement.`,

        "chronoa": `Chronoa — Time

Domain: Time (speed manipulation, slowing or accelerating events)
Description: Chronoa governs the relentless flow of time. An ancient and patient entity, it perceives 
the past, present, and future simultaneously. Those who awaken Chronoa may find their perception of events 
altered—moments may stretch or compress at will. Its presence bends reality, causing even the simplest 
actions to ripple through time. Legends say it favors mortals who show both foresight and adaptability, 
rewarding them with the power to manipulate temporal flow, accelerate growth, or slow foes in combat. 
Chronoa is enigmatic, never intervening directly, instead observing and nudging mortals toward their potential.`,

        "verdantia": `Verdantia — Life

Domain: Life (regeneration, growth, vitality)
Description: Verdantia embodies the flourishing of life. It is the essence of growth, healing, and vitality, 
often appearing as lush, ever-changing forms. Verdantia is drawn to beings who respect life in all forms, 
from the smallest seed to the grandest forest. Awakening it grants powers of rapid healing, accelerated 
growth of plants and creatures, and communion with living beings. Verdantia rarely speaks directly but 
communicates through subtle signs: blooms where it walks, rejuvenation in barren lands, and whispers in 
the wind. Those chosen must prove they can nurture life, not merely command it.`,

        "umbryx": `Umbryx — Shadow

Domain: Shadow (darkness manipulation, stealth, concealment)
Description: Umbryx is the embodiment of shadow and obscurity. Patient, calculating, and often perceived 
as cold, it moves through realms unseen, observing without interference. Its followers can control darkness, 
vanish into shadows, and manipulate fear in others. Umbryx is intrigued by cunning mortals, those who embrace 
subtlety and strategy. Awakening it requires proving mastery over concealment, perception, and mental resilience, 
as it favors those who thrive in ambiguity rather than brute strength.`,

        "entropy": `Entropy — Decay

Domain: Decay (corruption, withering, degradation)
Description: Entropy rules over the inevitability of decline. It represents the natural decay of matter, the 
corrosion of strength, and the fragility of existence. Mortals awakened by Entropy gain the ability to weaken 
structures, wither objects, and erode barriers over time. Its presence is unsettling; its whispers echo the 
truth that all things must end. Those who attract Entropy’s notice are resilient and daring, capable of 
understanding destruction as a tool rather than mere chaos. Completing its trials grants dominion over decay 
itself.`,

        "origen": `Origen — Creation

Domain: Creation (constructing, regenerating blocks, shaping matter)
Description: Origen is the architect of worlds, the divine hand behind structure and design. Its essence 
pulses with the ability to shape matter and restore what has been broken. Those who awaken Origen gain the 
power to recreate objects, forge new structures instantly, and manipulate raw materials. It is drawn to 
creativity, ingenuity, and those who imagine new possibilities. Origen’s influence extends silently, often 
leaving traces of its perfection in the natural world or the constructs of mortals it finds intriguing.`,

        "tethys": `Tethys — Water

Domain: Water (control over water, breathing underwater, fluid movement)
Description: Tethys governs the seas, rivers, and all flowing waters. Fluid and adaptable, it represents 
the duality of calm and storm. Mortals touched by Tethys can breathe underwater, move with the grace of 
currents, and command water itself. It favors those who are flexible, resourceful, and in tune with 
nature’s rhythms. Tethys appears rarely, often as waves shimmering with consciousness, testing mortals’ 
patience and adaptability before bestowing its gifts.`,

        "zephyra": `Zephyra — Wind

Domain: Wind (control over air, knockback, enhanced movement)
Description: Zephyra is the embodiment of air and motion, swift and unpredictable. Those who awaken it 
gain the ability to harness winds, glide or jump greater distances, and unleash gusts to repel enemies. 
It delights in nimble and daring mortals, valuing agility and ingenuity. Zephyra rarely reveals its full 
form, appearing as shifting clouds, breezes that guide or hinder, and whispers that carry secrets on the wind. 
Its lessons often involve precision, timing, and movement, rewarding those who master both speed and strategy.`,

        "pyros": `Pyros — Fire

Domain: Fire (burning, combustion, heat manipulation)
Description: Pyros embodies flame, passion, and destruction. Its presence warms or scorches, inspiring courage 
or fear. Those awakened gain control over fire, from lighting infernos to imbuing attacks with heat. Pyros 
favors bold mortals with strong will and fiery determination, rewarding those unafraid to face danger head-on. 
Its essence can consume or protect, making it as much a test of temperance as of skill. Legends say Pyros’ 
flames judge character before granting true mastery.`,

        "terranox": `Terranox — Earth

Domain: Earth (control of ground, defense, slowness manipulation)
Description: Terranox rules over stone, soil, and all that lies beneath. Solid, immovable, and steadfast, 
it embodies endurance and stability. Mortals granted Terranox’s favor can manipulate terrain, summon barriers, 
or slow enemies with crushing weight. It favors patience, strategy, and those who understand the value of 
foundation and preparation. Terranox’s trials often involve endurance, careful observation, and respect for the 
immovable forces of nature.`,

        "voltrix": `Voltrix — Storm

Domain: Storm (lightning, electricity, storms)
Description: Voltrix commands the skies, the raw energy of storms, and lightning strikes. Swift, volatile, 
and awe-inspiring, it rewards mortals capable of embracing chaos and harnessing energy. Those who awaken 
Voltrix can summon lightning, manipulate electrical forces, and call storms upon their enemies. It tests 
courage, adaptability, and decisiveness, choosing mortals bold enough to dance with tempests without being consumed.`
